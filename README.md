Welcome to the QT-Login-App!

This application utilizes a single table in the database, containing fields for the user's name, hashed password, and email. Users have the ability to retrieve their password through a simple method. When triggered, a unique 4-digit number is generated and displayed in the console. Users can employ this code to recover their password. The handling of this 4-digit code is flexible and can be managed as per your requirements. For instance, you have the option to send the retrieved code to the user's email at a later time. During the initial setup, users are required to sign up and create a new account.
