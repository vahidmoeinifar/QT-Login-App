Welcome to the QT-Login-App!

The app creates a simple SQLite database for the first application run. Only one table exists in the database with name, hashed password, and email. Also, users can retrieve password by a simple method. A 4-digit number will be printed in the console and user can recover password with this code. You can handle this 4-digit code whenever you want. For example, you can later send this retrieved code to user's email. For the first time, you need to Sign up and create a new user.
